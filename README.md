# Linux Mint Offline Hardening Scripts

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Linux hardening, where scripts written by AI will help turn your system into a fortress! This repository contains a bunch of Python scripts that will help you secure a Linux Mint installation before you connect to the internet. 
No more spooky stuff ‚Äì just solid security. My intent over time is to include some hardening rules from [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org) and [DISA STIG](https://www.titania.com/resources/guides/disa-stig-compliance-explained) guidelines that would improve security without impacting too much functionality for the average user. 
It should be perfect for beginner linux users like me that just want to browse the internet and play games on Steam while safeguarding privacy and protecting themselves from Hackers, Gangstalkers, or Witches and Warlocks! üòÜ

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Most Linux systems come with it pre-installed, so you should be good to go.

2. **Linux Mint**: This guide is specifically for Linux Mint, so make sure you've got that installed without connecting to the internet on that device. üëç

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to get the hardening scripts:

**Download the Repository**

   - Visit the GitHub repository: [Linux Mint Offline Hardening Scripts](https://github.com/bigbellybaus/linux-mint-offline-hardening-scripts.git).
   - Click the green "Code" button, and choose "Download ZIP."
   - Once downloaded, save the file to a USB stick then extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice on your Linux Mint install which has not yet connected to the internet.

## Usage

Now that you have the repository, here's how to run the Python scripts using Python 3:

1. **Open Terminal from Download Location**

Navigate to the location where you extracted the zip file using your file manager.
Right-click on an empty space within that location.
Choose "Open in Terminal" or a similar option depending on your file manager. This will open a terminal window with the current directory set to your download location.

2. **Run the Scripts**

We've got a collection of scripts for different security aspects. Run the one you need using Python 3. For example, to disable Bluetooth permanently, use:
```
sudo python3 disablebt.py
```
And for other scripts, just replace disablebt.py with the script's name.

3. **Follow the Prompts**

Our scripts are noob-friendly, just like this README. They'll guide you through the hardening process with simple prompts and explanations. Check out the AI comment that explains what each script does at the top of every file.

Sit Back and Relax

Once you've run the scripts, your system will be more secure than Fort Knox (well, almost). Enjoy your newly fortified Linux Mint!
